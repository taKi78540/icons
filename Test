Parfait 👍
Le parcours Step 2 – Select Accessories est très clair, cohérent avec le Step 1, et la logique UX est excellente (symétrie avec la sélection des équipements).

Je te propose ci-dessous un EPIC dédié + les User Stories associées, 100 % en anglais, prêtes pour Jira, dans la continuité exacte de ce que tu as déjà posé.

⸻

🟪 EPIC – Return Hardware – Select Accessories (Step 2)

Objective

Allow coaches to declare returned accessories, add them to the return summary, and explicitly confirm when no accessory is returned before moving to the final recap.

⸻

🟦 US1 – Display available accessories list

User Story

As a coach
I want to see a list of available accessories that can be returned
So that I can declare all accessories returned by the user

⸻

Description

On Step 2 – Select Accessories, the screen displays a list of accessories that can be declared as returned.

Each accessory:
	•	is displayed as a selectable item (checkbox / card)
	•	can be selected independently
	•	is not limited in number (list can scroll)

The list shown in the UI is not exhaustive in the mockup, but represents all accessories supported by the return process.

⸻

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am on Step 2 "Select accessories"
THEN a list of selectable accessories is displayed

AND each accessory can be selected or unselected independently


⸻

🟦 US2 – Add selected accessories to Return Summary

User Story

As a coach
I want selected accessories to be added to the Return Summary
So that I can track everything that has been declared as returned

⸻

Description
	•	When an accessory is selected:
	•	it is immediately added to the Return Summary panel
	•	When an accessory is unselected:
	•	it is removed from the Return Summary

⸻

Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I select an accessory
THEN it appears in the Return Summary

WHEN I unselect an accessory
THEN it is removed from the Return Summary


⸻

🟦 US3 – Optional comment for accessories return

User Story

As a coach
I want to add an optional comment related to accessories
So that I can provide context if needed (condition, missing parts, etc.)

⸻

Acceptance Criteria

THEN an optional comment field is displayed

AND leaving it empty does not block validation


⸻

🟦 US4 – Validate selected accessories

User Story

As a coach
I want to validate the selected accessories
So that they are confirmed as part of the return

⸻

Description
	•	Clicking VALIDATE confirms the currently selected accessories
	•	If at least one accessory is selected:
	•	validation proceeds directly to the next step

⸻

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN at least one accessory is selected
WHEN I click VALIDATE
THEN the accessories are confirmed
AND I am navigated to the next step


⸻

🟦 US5 – Confirmation modal when no accessory is selected

User Story

As a coach
I want to confirm that no accessory is returned
So that I do not skip accessory declaration by mistake

⸻

Description

If the coach clicks Next step (or equivalent navigation action) without selecting any accessory, a confirmation modal is displayed.

Modal content (as per mockup):
	•	Title: Confirmation
	•	Message:
“Are there any accessories to return?
Next step is the final recap.”
	•	Actions:
	•	No, there are → close modal and stay on accessory selection
	•	Yes, I confirm → continue to the next step

⸻

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN no accessory is selected
WHEN I click Next step
THEN a confirmation modal is displayed

WHEN I click "No, there are"
THEN the modal closes
AND I remain on Step 2 "Select accessories"

WHEN I click "Yes, I confirm"
THEN I am navigated to Step 3 "Return Summary"


⸻

🟦 US6 – Prevent navigation without explicit confirmation

User Story

As a Product Owner
I want to prevent navigation to the recap without confirmation when no accessory is selected
So that the process is explicit and error-proof

⸻

Acceptance Criteria

Navigation to Step 3 is blocked
WHEN no accessory is selected
UNTIL the confirmation modal is validated


⸻

🧠 Consistency with Step 1

This step follows the same design principles as Select Equipments:
	•	immediate update of Return Summary
	•	explicit validation
	•	confirmation modal when skipping a declaration
	•	no implicit assumptions

⸻
