Parfait, c’est une US manquante importante, et tu as très bien identifié le périmètre exact :
👉 on ne crée pas un nouveau parcours,
👉 on réutilise le même écran “Equipment details”,
👉 mais en mode “manual entry” au lieu de “pre-filled from HAM”.

Je te propose UNE User Story claire, qui s’imbrique parfaitement avec les US existantes (US3, US6, US7, US8, etc.), sans duplication inutile.

🟦 US – Manual equipment details entry when no match is found in HAM

User Story

As a coach
I want to manually enter equipment details when no match is found in HAM
So that I can still process a return even if the equipment is not referenced in the inventory

⸻

Context

This User Story is triggered from US3 – No match in HAM, when the coach clicks “Fill the form”.

Instead of displaying pre-filled equipment details (from HAM), the application opens the same equipment details screen, but in manual entry mode.

⸻

Description

When the coach clicks “Fill the form” after a failed HAM search:
	•	The application navigates to the Equipment Details screen
	•	The equipment identification section is empty and editable
	•	The coach must manually enter the equipment identification information
	•	All subsequent steps of the flow remain unchanged:
	•	stockroom selection
	•	power supply confirmation
	•	optional comment
	•	validation and addition to Return Summary

⸻

Manual Entry Rules – Equipment Identification

In manual mode:
	•	The following fields are editable:
	•	Barcode
	•	Serial number
	•	Computer name
	•	At least one of these three fields must be filled
	•	Other identification fields (model, type, etc.) are optional if present

⸻

Business Rules
	1.	Mandatory identification rule
	•	At least one of the following must be provided:
	•	Barcode
	•	Serial number
	•	Computer name
	2.	Validation dependency
	•	If none of the three fields is filled:
	•	the VALIDATE button remains disabled
	3.	Consistency with standard flow
	•	Stockroom selection rules remain unchanged (US7)
	•	Power supply confirmation remains mandatory (US8)
	•	Comment remains optional
	•	After VALIDATE, the equipment is added to the Return Summary like any other item

⸻

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)

GIVEN no equipment match is found in HAM
WHEN I click "Fill the form"
THEN I am navigated to the equipment details screen in manual entry mode

THEN the equipment identification fields are empty and editable

WHEN none of barcode, serial number or computer name is filled
THEN the VALIDATE button is disabled

WHEN at least one of barcode, serial number or computer name is filled
AND all other mandatory fields are completed
THEN the VALIDATE button becomes enabled

WHEN I click VALIDATE
THEN the manually entered equipment is added to the Return Summary


⸻

UX / Implementation Notes (for devs)
	•	The screen layout is identical to the standard equipment details screen
	•	Only the mode changes:
	•	prefilled = true (HAM match)
	•	prefilled = false (manual entry)
	•	Consider displaying a small label or badge:
“Manual entry”
to make the context explicit for the coach

⸻

Business Value
	•	Ensures no return is blocked due to inventory gaps
	•	Improves robustness of the return process
	•	Keeps a single, consistent UX for both known and unknown equipments
	•	Avoids creation of parallel or fragmented flows

👉 Tu peux ajouter cette US juste après US3 (No match in HAM) dans Jira.

Si tu veux, au prochain message, je peux :
	•	vérifier l’enchaînement exact des US pour Step 1 (ordre Jira optimal),
	•	ou t’aider à rédiger une US complémentaire côté back (flag “manual equipment”, traçabilité, CMDB sync, etc.).
