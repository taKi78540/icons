Parfait 👍
Je te fais donc la version CONSOLIDÉE, propre et linéaire du Hardware Allocation Process, avec :
	•	✅ un seul parcours cohérent
	•	✅ US dans le bon ordre fonctionnel
	•	✅ renumérotation propre (US1 → USn)
	•	✅ intégration de l’identification owner + contexte CM
	•	✅ gestion HM vs non-HM
	•	✅ réutilisation du module review / signature (sans redévelopper)

Tu peux la lire de haut en bas comme un scénario terrain.
