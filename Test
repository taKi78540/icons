Hi Daniela,

Thanks for your question!

The “Live waiting time” for newcomers is calculated based on the estimated delay before a visitor is taken in charge by a coach, assuming they just arrived now.
This value is not a retrospective average, nor based on the last visitor, but rather a real-time projection using current workload and ongoing visitor handling times.

When it went from 0 to 18 minutes, it likely means:
	•	There were no visitors in the queue (0 min), so the estimated time was immediate.
	•	A new visitor arrived, and based on the current number of ongoing visits and coach availability, the system projected that this newcomer would have to wait about 18 minutes before being helped.

Let me know if you’d like me to show you the logic or formula in more detail.
