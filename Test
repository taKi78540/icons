3. Team Mobilization â€“ High Wait Time Threshold Reached (Enhanced Notification)

When the high wait time threshold is exceeded, a Teams notification is automatically sent to a configurable group of users (e.g. managers, agents, or local support staff).

ðŸŸ¢ New evolution (Short Term)
This feature is being enhanced to include additional contextual indicators directly within the notification card, such as:
	â€¢	Current average wait time
	â€¢	Number of visitors waiting and in progress
	â€¢	Coach availability and status
	â€¢	Duration since the threshold was first exceeded

These insights will allow teams to quickly assess the situation, understand how long the desk has been under pressure, and mobilize the right support when visitor flow peaks.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals
	â€¢	Alert the right people in real time
	â€¢	Provide detailed context to support rapid decision-making
	â€¢	Reinforce the desk efficiently during periods of high activity
