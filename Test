Here is the English version of your summary for Christopher:
	•	Tablet design:
The tablet should be ordered in black to better match the counter’s design. It will later be customized with the logo and possibly a message for the employee.
	•	Cable management:
The cable will no longer exit from the side. It will run underneath the tablet and come out the back, resulting in a cleaner setup.
	•	Base security:
The stand is heavy, which reduces the need for daily handling by technicians. The goal is to secure it permanently to avoid any daily actions. We’re currently exploring possible solutions.
	•	Access to iPad buttons:
Since the tablet is enclosed, the buttons are no longer accessible. This isn’t an issue:
	•	Automatic shutdown can be scheduled in the evening.
	•	In the morning, reconnecting the power turns the iPad on automatically.
	•	Unlocking the device is not a problem.
	•	Guided Access is no longer necessary: with the current frame, it’s impossible to press the buttons or exit the app (even using the navigation bar).
	•	Conclusion:
The user experience is clearly better with this setup. The remaining points need to be addressed to ensure the same level of simplicity and efficiency for technicians, without requiring manual actions each morning and evening.
