Sure! Here’s the English version of the explanation:

⸻

This graph shows the estimated waiting time and how it has evolved:
	•	The green bar (“Waiting”) represents the time already spent waiting, which is 14 minutes.
	•	The total estimated waiting time is 29 minutes, as shown below (“estimated 29 min”).
	•	The orange section (+15 min) indicates that the current estimated wait time is 15 minutes longer than what was originally predicted. For example, the system may have originally estimated a 14-minute wait, but it has now increased to 29 minutes.
	•	The yellow bar (“Processing”) on the right is a projection: once the person is taken in charge, the estimated processing time will be 17 minutes.

⸻

In summary:

The person has already waited 14 minutes, and the system now estimates 15 more minutes to go, making a total of 29 minutes. The upcoming processing time is expected to take around 17 minutes.
