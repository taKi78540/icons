Parfait 👍
Voici la version anglaise, prête à être copiée/collée dans Jira, de l’EPIC Return Hardware – Layout & Navigation Framework avec ses User Stories.
J’ai utilisé un anglais clair, produit, orienté Jira, sans ambiguïté pour les développeurs.

🟪 EPIC – Return Hardware – Layout & Navigation Framework

Objective

Provide a consistent and persistent layout framework for the Return Hardware journey, ensuring that coaches are guided through each step with clear navigation, visibility of progress, and a standardized user experience across all screens.

Description

This epic covers all structural and persistent UI components used across the Return Hardware process, independently of the business logic of each step.

It includes:
	•	A fixed header identifying the process
	•	A non-clickable stepper showing progress
	•	A persistent action bar with BACK and NEXT navigation
	•	Consistent behavior across all steps, including error states (modal/toast)

The goal is to provide a solid UI foundation so that each functional step only focuses on its own business content.

Business Value
	•	Improves coach experience and clarity
	•	Reduces navigation errors
	•	Standardizes guided processes
	•	Speeds up development of future similar journeys (Onboarding, Exchange, etc.)
	•	Ensures UI consistency and robustness

🟦 US1 – Display a non-clickable stepper for the Return Hardware process

User Story

As a coach
I want to see a stepper showing all steps of the Return Hardware process
So that I clearly understand where I am and what remains to be done

Description

A stepper is displayed on all screens of the Return Hardware journey.
It contains exactly 5 steps, in the following order:
	1.	Owner Search
	2.	Equipment Selection
	3.	Form Filling
	4.	Return Summary
	5.	Signature & Confirmation

The stepper:
	•	Highlights the current step
	•	Marks completed steps
	•	Displays upcoming steps as inactive
	•	Is not clickable
	•	Is always visible throughout the journey

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am in the Return Hardware process
WHEN the screen is displayed
THEN a stepper with 5 steps is visible

WHEN a step is active
THEN it is visually highlighted

WHEN a step is completed
THEN it is displayed as completed

WHEN I click on a step in the stepper
THEN no navigation occurs

THEN the stepper remains visible on all steps of the journey

🟦 US2 – Display a fixed header with the process title

User Story

As a coach
I want to see a fixed header displaying the process title
So that I always know which process I am currently in

The exact title displayed is:

RETURN HARDWARE PROCESS

The header:
	•	Is always visible
	•	Does not disappear between steps
	•	Remains visible even when errors occur (modal or toast)
	•	Follows the validated UI design

Acceptance Criteria

🟦 US3 – Display a persistent action bar with BACK and NEXT buttons

User Story

As a coach
I want to have permanent BACK and NEXT buttons
So that I can easily navigate between steps of the process

Description

A persistent action bar is displayed above the footer on all steps of the Return Hardware journey.

It contains:
	•	BACK button: navigates to the previous step
	•	NEXT button: validates the current step and moves forward

Behavior:
	•	NEXT is disabled until the current step is valid
	•	BACK does not reset previously entered data
	•	The action bar is always visible
	•	Header and action bar remain visible during error handling (modal or toast)

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am on a step of the Return Hardware process
THEN a persistent action bar with BACK and NEXT buttons is visible

WHEN the step is not valid
THEN the NEXT button is disabled

WHEN I click BACK
THEN I return to the previous step
AND previously entered data is preserved

WHEN I click NEXT
THEN the current step is validated
AND I move to the next step

WHEN an error modal or toast is displayed
THEN the header and action bar remain visible
