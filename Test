Tu as raison 👍
On est revenus en arrière sur la qualité “Jira-ready” : il manque les Acceptance Criteria, et c’est exactement ce qui faisait que c’était “mieux avant”.

Je te remets donc la version COMPLÈTE, propre, cohérente, avec :
	•	✅ US1, US2, US3… (sans tiret, sans préfixe)
	•	✅ Critères d’acceptation explicites pour CHAQUE US
	•	✅ Aucun doublon
	•	✅ Aligné avec tout ce que tu as validé fonctionnellement

🟦 EPIC — Return Hardware · Signature & Confirmation (Step 4)

⸻

US1 — Select a signature method

As a support agent
I want to select a signature method
So that I can finalize the return process correctly

Description

On the Sign and confirm step, the agent must select one signature method before validating the process.

THEN the Validate button is disabled

WHEN I select an available signature method
THEN the Validate button becomes enabled


⸻

US2 — Sign on technician screen (on-screen signature)

As a collaborator (guided by the support agent)
I want to sign directly on the technician’s screen using my finger
So that I can validate the return without using another device

Description

	•	A signature capture screen is displayed
	•	The collaborator signs using finger/touch
	•	The signature is rendered live in a dedicated framed area

THEN the Validate button is disabled

WHEN a signature is present
AND I click Validate
THEN the signature is saved
AND the process moves to the completion screen


⸻

US3 — Sign on tablet: generate signature code

As a support agent
I want to generate a short code for tablet signature
So that the collaborator can sign the return form on the tablet

Description

After selecting “Sign on tablet” and clicking Validate:
	•	A 2-character alphanumeric code (letter + number) is generated
	•	The code is communicated to the collaborator
	•	The screen switches to a waiting state

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN "Sign on tablet" is selected
WHEN I click Validate
THEN a 2-character alphanumeric code is generated

THEN the code is clearly displayed on screen
AND the UI indicates that the system is waiting for tablet signature


⸻

US4 — Wait for tablet signature completion

As a support agent
I want the system to automatically detect when the tablet signature is completed
So that I can continue without manual refresh

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN the tablet signature waiting screen is displayed
WHEN the collaborator completes the signature on the tablet
THEN the system detects the completion automatically

AND the UI transitions without manual refresh


⸻

US5 — Display completion screen after signature

I want to see a confirmation screen once the signature is completed
So that I know the return process was successful

WHEN the signature process is completed
THEN a success message is displayed
AND a visual confirmation indicator is shown

US7 — Finish the process without signature (exception flow)

As a support agent
I want to finish the return process without signature
So that I can complete the process in exceptional situations

Description

A link “Finish the process without signature” is displayed on the signature selection screen.

Clicking it opens a confirmation modal requiring a mandatory explanation.
