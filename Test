Très bonne amélioration 👍
C’est plus contrôlable, moins bruité côté backend, et plus explicite côté UX, surtout avec le scan.

Je te propose UNE User Story dédiée, claire, prête à être ajoutée à l’EPIC Step 1 – Select Equipments, et qui remplace officiellement la recherche automatique.

⸻

🟦 US – Explicit equipment search with Search button and Enter key

User Story

As a coach
I want to explicitly trigger the equipment search using a Search button or the Enter key
So that I stay in control of when the lookup is performed after scanning or typing an identifier

⸻

Description

On Step 1 – Select Equipments, the automatic search triggered on character input is replaced by an explicit search action.

The equipment lookup is triggered only when:
	•	the coach clicks a Search button next to the input field, or
	•	the coach presses the Enter key in the input field

The input field continues to support:
	•	barcode scanning
	•	manual typing
	•	accepted identifiers:
	•	barcode
	•	serial number
	•	computer name

⸻

Behavior Rules
	•	No search is triggered while typing characters
	•	The entered/scanned value remains editable until search is explicitly triggered
	•	After search:
	•	results are displayed (HAM lookup)
	•	or the “No match in HAM” message is shown

⸻

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am on Step 1 "Select Equipments"
THEN an equipment input field and a "Search" button are displayed

WHEN I type or scan an equipment identifier
THEN no search is triggered automatically

WHEN I click the "Search" button
OR I press the Enter key
THEN the application searches for the equipment in HAM

WHEN matching equipments are found
THEN the results list is displayed

WHEN no equipment is found
THEN the "No match in HAM" message is displayed
AND the "Fill the form" option is available


⸻

UX / Implementation Notes (for devs)
	•	The Enter key behavior must be equivalent to clicking the Search button
	•	The Search button should be disabled if the input field is empty
	•	Optional (nice-to-have): show a loading indicator while the search is in progress
	•	The previous “auto-search after X characters” behavior is fully removed

⸻

Business Value
	•	Prevents unnecessary backend calls
	•	Improves clarity when using barcode scanners
	•	Reduces false positives during partial input
	•	Gives full control to the coach over the search action

⸻

Si tu veux, je peux ensuite :
	•	mettre à jour les US existantes (US1 / US2) pour retirer toute référence à l’auto-search
	•	ou te proposer le wording exact du bouton (Search / Find / Lookup) selon vos standards UX

Dis-moi 👍
