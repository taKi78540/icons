Parfait 👍
Voici UN PROMPT COMPLET ET PRÉCIS EN ANGLAIS, prêt à être envoyé tel quel dans Figma Make, pour ajouter la fonctionnalité d’inventaire dans la vue Stock Overview, sans ambiguïté fonctionnelle.

👉 Ce prompt est structuré pour que Figma comprenne :
	•	où placer les actions
	•	comment se déroule l’inventaire
	•	quelles données doivent être visibles avant / pendant / après

🔧 FIGMA MAKE UPDATE PROMPT – Stock Inventory workflow (Stock Overview)

You are extending the Stock Overview feature in
“Le Comptoir Stock Management” by adding a full inventory workflow.

This feature must be clear, guided, and auditable.
Do not simplify. Do not omit any step.

⸻

1) Stock Overview – New inventory entry points

1.1 Add “Start inventory” action

In the Stock Overview section:
	•	Add a visible button: Start inventory
	•	This button is global to the Stock Overview (not per category)

Near this button, also add:
	•	A secondary button: Inventory history

Both buttons must be clearly visible and accessible.

⸻

2) Start inventory – Configuration modal

Clicking Start inventory opens a modal to configure the inventory scope.

2.1 Inventory scope selection (mandatory)

In the modal, allow the user to configure:
	•	Hardware category (mandatory, single selection)
	•	Example: Workstation, Mobile, Headset
	•	Only one category can be inventoried at a time
	•	Model selection (optional, within the selected category)
	•	Options:
	•	All models
	•	One specific model
	•	Multiple selected models (checkbox list)

These fields must be:
	•	Clickable
	•	Clearly explained
	•	Validated before proceeding

⸻

2.2 Inventory start action

Actions in the modal:
	•	Cancel
	•	Start inventory

Starting the inventory opens the inventory scanning view.

⸻

3) Inventory scanning view (core workflow)

3.1 Inventory context display

At the top of the inventory screen, display:
	•	Selected category
	•	Selected model(s)
	•	Inventory status (In progress)

⸻

3.2 Expected items list

The system must display:
	•	The list of expected items (equipment supposed to be present)
	•	Based on:
	•	Selected category
	•	Selected models
	•	Current stockroom

Each expected item shows:
	•	Barcode
	•	Model
	•	Status:
	•	Not scanned
	•	Scanned (found)

⸻

3.3 Scanning behavior

When scanning equipment:

Case 1 – Expected item
	•	Mark item as Found
	•	Update status in the list

Case 2 – Unexpected item
	•	Item is not expected in this inventory scope
	•	Display it in a separate section:
	•	Unexpected items found
	•	Highlight visually

⸻

4) Inventory completion & summary

4.1 Inventory summary screen

When the user finishes scanning and clicks Complete inventory, display a summary showing:
	•	Total expected items
	•	Items found
	•	Items missing (expected but not scanned)
	•	Items unexpected (scanned but not expected)

This distinction is mandatory.

⸻

4.2 Inventory validation

Actions:
	•	Cancel (return to scanning)
	•	Validate inventory

Once validated:
	•	Inventory is closed
	•	Results are saved
	•	No further modification possible

⸻

5) Stock Overview – Inventory indicators

5.1 Inventory freshness per model

In the Stock Overview list, for each model:
	•	Display “Days since last inventory”
	•	Example: “12 days ago”
	•	Do NOT display exact dates
	•	This value updates after each validated inventory

This indicator must be:
	•	Visible
	•	Readable
	•	Useful for operational follow-up

⸻

6) Inventory history

6.1 Inventory history access

Clicking Inventory history opens a modal displaying:
	•	List of past inventories
	•	Ordered from most recent to oldest

Each inventory entry shows:
	•	Category
	•	Model(s)
	•	Inventory date
	•	Summary:
	•	Found / Missing / Unexpected counts

⸻

6.2 Inventory details

Clicking an inventory entry opens a detail view showing:
	•	Full list of:
	•	Expected items
	•	Found items
	•	Missing items
	•	Unexpected items
	•	Clear separation between each group

This view is read-only.

⸻

7) Roles & permissions (important)
	•	Inventory actions are available to:
	•	Campus role
	•	Central Stock Manager
	•	Purchase role:
	•	Cannot start inventories
	•	Can view inventory history (read-only)
	•	Business role:
	•	No access to inventory

⸻

8) UX & design constraints
	•	Inventory workflow must be:
	•	Guided
	•	Step-by-step
	•	Easy to understand for non-technical users
	•	Scanning view must:
	•	Support long lists
	•	Be scrollable
	•	Clearly distinguish item states

Avoid:
	•	Complex tables
	•	Hidden actions
	•	Ambiguous statuses

⸻

Expected result
	•	Inventories are easy to launch
	•	Scope is clearly defined
	•	Discrepancies are immediately visible
	•	Inventory freshness is visible per model
	•	Full audit trail is available via history

⸻

Validation sentence

If a user cannot clearly see what was expected, what was found,
what is missing, and what should not have been there,
then the inventory feature is incomplete.

⸻

✅ END OF UPDATE PROMPT – Stock Inventory

Si tu veux, prochaine étape possible :
	•	🎨 améliorer la lisibilité visuelle du scan d’inventaire
	•	🧠 ajouter un statut post-inventaire (OK / Attention / Action required)
	•	📊 exploiter l’inventaire pour alertes automatiques

Dis-moi 👍
