ðŸ§  Advanced Wait Time Analysis

This section helps you dive deeper into situations where wait times at the counter exceed a critical threshold, which you can adjust directly (default: 30 minutes).

Two key insights are provided to better understand these periods:
	1.	Coach availability during peak wait times
This chart shows the average and maximum number of coaches present when the wait time exceeds the selected threshold. It helps identify potential understaffing or unexpected surges in demand.
	2.	Total duration of extended wait times by day
This chart displays the total number of minutes per day where the wait time exceeded the chosen threshold. It allows you to spot peak days and detect recurring patterns.

ðŸ‘‰ Use the input field to define the wait time threshold you want to analyze (e.g., 20 min, 45 min, etc.).
The charts will update automatically based on your selection.
