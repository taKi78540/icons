Hello everyone, my name is Arnaud Lecorre, and I am the Product Owner of the Le Comptoir application. I believe Christian has already explained how the application works, so I won’t go into those details again. Today, I would like to introduce myself, explain our organization, and then walk you through our roadmap so you can clearly see the upcoming work and evaluate the resources you might allocate to support us.

Regarding our organization, we work in agile mode, with two-week sprints. My role as Product Owner is to identify user needs, translate these needs into mockups, and then hand them over to the development team. We then validate the developments together before releasing them into production.

Now, let’s move on to the roadmap. It is divided into three main timeframes: short term, medium term, and long term.

In the short term, which covers the next month, several evolutions have already been completed. For example, the Teams notifications are finished, and the final deployment will happen tomorrow evening. Then, there are the Power BI reports. These reports are created by me and are currently intended only for the managers of the service desks. This topic does not require your involvement, as I handle it directly. Regarding the tablets, we are about to start the development of customized buttons. This feature will allow each service desk to create buttons adapted to their local needs, for example to help with orientation or to quickly launch specific tasks. The goal is to have this finished and deployed by the end of August.

Moving on to the medium term, covering the next two to three months, I plan to create additional documentation, including RACI matrices and detailed procedures. For the Power BI reports, I will prepare them for real-time updates, which will then be managed by our Atavis team. Another important topic is service continuity. Currently, if we experience network issues or if external applications like ServiceNow are unavailable, it often requires manual actions from technical teams to restore operations. We want to improve the tablets’ ability to automatically reconnect to Wi-Fi when there is a network problem, and also add notifications to alert our teams if something prevents the application from working correctly.
As for badge recognition, this project is currently blocked because we depend on the building badge managers in France to set up an API that would allow us to access badge data.

Finally, in the long term, which is beyond four months, we have some very important topics. The first one is to implement full tracking of hardware movements. This means that when a user receives or returns equipment at a service desk, we want to declare it, have them sign electronically, and automatically update our databases. Another key topic is creating a centralized planning tool for the entire group to manage onboardings and similar events.
Regarding the TVs installed in our service desks, we want to evolve these screens so that they display dynamic content cycling every 20 to 30 seconds. This content could include webinars, company news, or digital workplace updates, so that we can take advantage of the waiting time to engage with users and communicate important information.

In addition, we also plan to integrate some AI features to improve key performance indicators. For example, in Power BI, we want to analyze and display the top three reasons for user dissatisfaction at the service desks, as well as identify which knowledge base articles are most frequently used. Regarding hardware, we plan to replace the current mini PCs with Apple TVs for the TVs in our service desks, since Microsoft will soon support Apple TVs through Intune device management. We also aim to handle different types of building access cards, including HID and Desfire protocols, to improve compatibility.
For users, we will integrate information about the queue and other updates into platforms like SAM Marketplace or chatbots, so that users can easily access relevant information through multiple channels. Finally, we will continue to enrich the TVs with even more dynamic content to keep users informed and engaged while they wait.

That concludes my overview of the roadmap. As you can see, there is a lot of work planned, covering many different areas, and we will need your expertise and support to successfully implement these developments. I hope this gives you a clear picture of our upcoming needs, and I look forward to hearing how many resources you will be able to provide to help us.
