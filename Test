Here is the full version in English, structured for a presentation at the Styrco Group, covering the key pillars of Sustainable IT for the Workspace stream:

⸻

1. Hardware Sustainability (Device Lifecycle Management)

Current Status & Achievements:
	•	From 2026 onwards, all laptops will be acquired through leasing via 3 STEP IT (IT Group & Business Units). This approach aims to extend the lifespan of devices up to 5 years (to be confirmed).
	•	An End-of-Life strategy is being defined, also via 3 STEP IT, to ensure structured recovery and proper reuse or recycling of devices.

Key Indicators:
	•	Average PC age: increased from 2.9 to 3.5 years.
	•	Average screen age: currently 6 years.

Challenges & Risks:
	•	Extending lifespan without degrading user experience.
	•	Ensuring consistent adoption across all regions and entities.
	•	Monitoring carbon footprint across the full lifecycle (manufacture to disposal).

⸻

2. Asset Traceability & Responsible Management

Current Status & Achievements:
	•	Implementation of a feature in the “Le Comptoir” app to track all hardware movements (handover/return), including digital signature by users and technicians.
	•	Automatic update of the Hardware Asset Management (HAM) database.
	•	Global rollout planned by end of 2025.

Challenges & Risks:
	•	Extension to non-Comptoir flows is under analysis.
	•	Coverage of off-desk or non-traditional asset flows still needs improvement.

3. Data Management & Digital Footprint

Current Status & Achievements:
	•	NAS to SharePoint migration has been initiated by entities.
	•	Storing data in SharePoint (Microsoft cloud) helps reduce local infrastructure and GHG emissions (Scope 3).

Challenges & Risks:
	•	No unified migration strategy yet: Without clear rules based on data type and age, there’s a risk of SharePoint overload.
	•	Data duplication and poor version control can negatively impact both efficiency and carbon impact.

⸻

4. Awareness & Responsible Usage

Current Status & Achievements:
	•	Power Apps licenses have been distributed (10,000 Fortis, 1,300 BCEF, 700 IT Group) for access to the MyGreenIT tool.
	•	The tool enables employees to track and understand their own digital footprint.
	•	Licenses can be reassigned internally after use (1 to 3 months), and pricing follows a gradual decreasing model.

Challenges & Risks:
	•	Need for broader communication and user engagement to ensure real usage of the tool.
	•	License sharing logic must be well-managed to ensure availability and avoid underuse.
