Hi Andrei,
So, how does the Card Reader work on the tablets? Basically, employees’ cards are not known to the system before their first visit to the counter. For the card to be automatically registered, when the user scans their card, a message should appear saying they are not recognized. At that point, the user must enter their UID and confirm their identity. Once validated, the card is then linked to the user.

However, if the user goes back when asked to enter their UID, the card will not be linked.

Can you check if it’s working as I described?
And if the registration still doesn’t happen, it might be because your cards are not MIFARE type cards. In that case, the Card Reader being used may not be the right one.

Souhaites-tu une version plus formelle ou plus technique ?
