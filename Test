Parfait, merci pour la remise à plat 👍
Là c’est très clair, et on peut poser des US propres, linéaires, non redondantes, strictement basées sur ce que tu viens de décrire et sur les maquettes.

Je te propose donc le parcours Tablet – Signature, découpé en US1 → US5, avec critères d’acceptation remis, format Jira-ready, sans spéculation technique.

⸻

🟦 EPIC — Return Hardware · Tablet Signature (User Journey)

Goal

Allow a visitor (depositor) to complete the return process by signing on a shared tablet, in a simple, guided, and self-service flow.

⸻

US1 — Select activity on tablet (Survey or Signature)

As a visitor
I want to choose between giving feedback or signing a form
So that I can start the correct process on the tablet

Description

When arriving on the tablet, the visitor sees a welcome screen with:
	•	Two main actions:
	•	Opinion Survey
	•	eSignature
	•	Each action is represented by a large, clearly identifiable button.

Only the eSignature path is in scope for this epic.

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am on the tablet welcome screen
THEN I see two main actions: Opinion Survey and eSignature

WHEN I click on eSignature
THEN I am redirected to the signature code entry screen


⸻

US2 — Enter validation code on tablet

As a visitor
I want to enter the validation code given by the coach
So that I can access my return summary

Description

After selecting eSignature, the visitor sees:
	•	An instruction explaining that a code was provided by the coach
	•	A virtual keyboard
	•	A code input field (2 characters)
	•	A validation action via the green confirmation key

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am on the code entry screen
THEN a virtual keyboard is displayed
AND a code input field is visible

WHEN I enter a 2-character code and press the validation key
THEN the code is submitted

WHEN the code is invalid
THEN an error message is displayed
AND I remain on the code entry screen


⸻

US3 — Display return summary for visitor review

As a visitor
I want to review the returned items
So that I can confirm everything is correct before signing

Description

Once the code is validated, the visitor sees:
	•	A read-only return summary
	•	The list of equipments returned
	•	Relevant information per item (type, model, identifiers, power supply status if applicable)

The visitor can:
	•	Go back
	•	Or proceed by clicking Confirm and Sign

Acceptance Criteria

WHEN the code is valid
THEN the return summary screen is displayed

AND the summary is read-only

WHEN I click on Confirm and Sign
THEN I am redirected to the signature screen


⸻

US4 — Capture signature on tablet

As a visitor
I want to sign the form using my finger
So that I can officially confirm the return

Description

The visitor is presented with:
	•	A dedicated signature area
	•	Instructions to sign with their finger
	•	Two actions:
	•	Cancel
	•	Validate

The Validate action is only enabled once a signature is drawn.

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am on the signature screen
THEN a signature area is displayed

WHEN no signature is drawn
THEN the Validate button is disabled

WHEN I draw a signature
THEN the Validate button becomes enabled

WHEN I click Validate
THEN the signature is submitted


⸻

US5 — Display confirmation after successful signature

As a visitor
I want to see a confirmation message
So that I know the process is completed

Description

After a successful signature:
	•	A confirmation screen is displayed
	•	A success message indicates that everything is in order
	•	The visitor is invited to meet the coach to finalize the visit

No further action is required from the visitor.

Acceptance Criteria

WHEN the signature is successfully submitted
THEN a confirmation screen is displayed

AND the message confirms that the process is fully completed


⸻

Si tu veux, prochaine étape possible (quand tu voudras) :
	•	lier ces US avec les US côté coach (code generation / waiting state)
	•	ou faire un mapping exact tablette ↔ écran coach
	•	ou préparer une version ultra-condensée pour validation métier

Tu me dis 👌
