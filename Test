Parfait 👍
Je te fais donc la restitution COMPLÈTE, structurée et exploitable, avec :
	•	EPICs claires
	•	User Stories numérotées (US1, US2, …)
	•	Critères d’acceptation
	•	sans redévelopper ce qui est explicitement réutilisé (confirmation & signature)
	•	sans back-end détaillé
	•	cohérent Jira / grooming / validation métier

Tu pourras copier-coller tel quel et ajuster si besoin.
