Bien vu 👍 et merci de la correction.
Voici l’US mise à jour, strictement identique fonctionnellement, avec HAM partout (et plus HM).

US19 — Display enriched completion confirmation with HAM vs non-HAM follow-up

As a technician
I want the final confirmation screen to clearly indicate follow-up actions
So that I know whether additional actions are required after the allocation

⸻

Description

After the allocation process is completed (review + signature done), the technician sees a final confirmation screen that includes:

1️⃣ Global confirmation message
	•	Example:
“Allocation completed successfully.”

⸻

2️⃣ Section — Equipment managed in HAM
	•	List of allocated equipment managed in HAM
	•	Informational message:
“No additional action required. These equipments are managed in HAM.”

⸻

3️⃣ Section — Equipment not managed in HAM
	•	List of allocated equipment not managed in HAM
	•	Informational warning message:
“Follow-up required. An incident has been created with all necessary information. Please apply the required updates/actions in the relevant tools.”
	•	Display available identifiers for each equipment:
	•	Barcode
	•	Serial number
	•	Computer name (if applicable)
	•	Display incident reference when available

This screen is read-only and informational only.

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN the allocation process is completed and signed
THEN a final confirmation screen is displayed

AND the screen includes a global success confirmation message

IF one or more allocated equipments are managed in HAM
THEN they are listed under a "No action required" section

IF one or more allocated equipments are not managed in HAM
THEN they are listed under a "Follow-up required" section

AND the screen clearly explains that an incident has been created

AND equipment identifiers are displayed for traceability

IF an incident reference exists
THEN it is displayed next to the relevant equipment


⸻

🔁 Reminder
	•	Cette US complète la confirmation finale
	•	Elle ne crée pas d’écran supplémentaire
	•	Elle sécurise le cas non-HAM sans alourdir le parcours

Si tu veux, prochain pas possible :
	•	figer définitivement la liste des US Allocation
	•	ou revenir sur le parcours de restitution (Return) pour vérifier qu’on a un closing équivalent (HAM / non-HAM)
	•	ou attaquer la validation métier / sécurité IT de tout ça
