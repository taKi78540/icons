	1.	Deferred ServiceNow Ticket Creation
Allow visit creation even if ServiceNow is unavailable; tickets will be automatically generated once ServiceNow becomes accessible again.
	2.	Automatic Tablet Reconnection
Implement a mechanism on the reception tablets to continuously attempt to reconnect to the Wi-Fi network, with automatic recovery of the application once connectivity is restored.
	3.	Server Unavailability Alert System
Develop automatic notifications to inform technical teams and Le Comptoir managers when the application is completely unavailable, with alerts also sent when service is restored.
